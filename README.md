# OpenAI Function Calling example in Node.js
This repository contains a basic Node.js example demonstrating how to call functions using the OpenAI API. The example showcases a conversation with the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model, including making function calls and processing their responses.

## Getting Started

**Dependencies**: This project has no external dependencies, making it lightweight and easy to set up. You can run this example with just Node.js. However, if you have a preferred library or tool for making HTTP requests, feel free to integrate it as needed to enhance the functionality or suit your specific requirements.

To get started with this example:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone <this-repo>
   ```

2. Obtain an API key from <a href="https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys">OpenAI</a>

3. Replace ```Bearer sk-xxxxxxxxx``` in the code with your API key.

4. Run the example:

```shell
node index.js
```

5. Customise the functions and conversation as needed. In this example, a simple weather-related function is included, but you can add more functions to suit your use case.

## Usage
This repository serves as a starting point for understanding how to integrate function calls into your conversational AI system using the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model. You can extend the example by adding more functions, handling different types of requests, and tailoring it to your specific application.
